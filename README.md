# PokeAPI Coding Challenge

Welcome to the PokeAPI Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your skills in data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis using the PokeAPI. The tasks are inspired by the alert tuning processes a SOC analyst might perform.

## Challenge Overview

You will be required to complete a series of tasks using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). This take home consists of 7 questions. Each question will test different aspects of data handling and analysis.

- Please make sure you read and adhere the PokeAPI Fair Use Policy and guidance. 
- Please limit your data set to the first 151 Pokemon. 
- You are free to use LLMs however please bear in mind your code will be reviewed and you will be asked to defend decisions made about your code choices. 

While completing the take-home task, consider exploring all possibilities, theres always more to a challenge. The delivery is open to interpretation, and we encourage creativity in your approach. Please treat this as a production piece of code that any team member could run. Think outside the box!

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with RESTful APIs
- Basic understanding of data manipulation, aggregation and analysis.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Manipulation

**Question**: Fetch data for the Pokémon "Pikachu" and extract its abilities, types, and base stats. Give the option to present this data in a machine readable format and a human readable format.

### 2. Dynamic Data Manipulation

**Question**: Extending from Q1, make it so that we can request this information of any pokemon.

### 3. Basic Aggregation by Count

**Question**: Retrieve a list of Pokémon and count how many belong to each type. Display the results in descending order of count.

### 4. Basic Aggregation by average

**Question**: For each Pokémon type, calculate the average base experience of all Pokémon of that type. Identify the type with the highest average base speed.

### 5. Distinct Count of Multiple Fields

**Question**: Determine the number of distinct abilities and moves across all Pokémon. Present the counts separately.

### 6. Group by Type and Distinct Moves

**Question**: Group Pokémon by their primary type and list distinct moves for each group. Identify the most common move within each type group.

### 7. Data Analysis

**Question**: For each Pokémon type, identify the top 3 Pokémon with the highest total base stats (sum of all base stats). Then, calculate the average number of moves these top Pokémon have. Finally, determine which type has the most diverse move set among its top 3 Pokémon.
